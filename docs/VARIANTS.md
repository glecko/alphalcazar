#Alternative Game Variants#

##A note on mixing variants##
Some variants play well together. The "No draw", "Uneven powers" and "Pusher tag" variants have been played together successfully.

##Classic##
Tiles with number 4 are Pushers, tiles with number 1 are pushable by any other number (on their own only).

##No draw##
Whenever both players score a 3 in line at once, rather than considering it a tie, keep on playing, until there is a single winner.
_Tested: 5 games, 2 players_

##Diagonals##
Tiles can move long diagonals the same  way they  do along rows and columns.
_Tested: 2 games, 2 players_

##Pusher tag##
No specific  tile is the  pusher. The pusher is  a  tag / label that can be added  to the  piece that is being played in any given round. Once that  tile returns to the player, the pusher tag can be assigned to a different tile.
_Tested: 2 games, 2 players_

###Pusher tag: pusher change###
If their pusher tag is in game, instead of playing a tile, a player may decide to change the pusher tag from its current tile to another one of their tiles.
_Tested: 0 games, 0 players_

##Uneven powers##
Two actions are added to the game, which can be taken  in substitution of the standard action of placing a tile. The first player of the round may take the “change orientation” action, and change the direction one of their tiles in game is pointing at. The second player of the round may take the “stop” action, by selecting one of their tiles in game: that tile will not make its move this round.
_Tested: 2 games, 2 players_

###Uneven powers: orientation change unlimited###
The “change orientation” action can be taken on an opponent’s tile as well.
_Tested: 0 games, 0 players_

###Uneven powers: stop unlimited###
The “stop” action can be taken on an opponent’s tile as well.
_Tested: 0 games, 0 players_

###Uneven powers: stop and freeze###
The “stop” action not only prevents the selected tile from taking its move, but also prevents it from moving at all (e.g. this prevents it from being pushed).
_Tested: 0 games, 0 players_

##Push by mass##
The number on a  tile is considered its "mass". Any tile can push the tiles in front of it, as long as the sum of the masses of those tiles is lower than its own mass value.
_Tested: 0 games, 0 players_

###Push by mass: load the tiles###
All tiles start empty. Each player has 10 individual units of mass at their disposal.
When playing a tile, its owner can add as many units of mass on it as desired. This mass becomes their move order number.
Tiles belonging to the same player with the same amount of mass can be dealt with by the player having the choice in which one moves first.

##Unique pieces with drafting##
All tiles are unique. The game starts with  both players selecting their tiles through drafting. Then the game plays out as usual.
10 possible tiles:
1 Pushable
2 Pushable (besides 1-4)
3 Jumper (if field to enter is blocked, jump to the next available one
4 Runner (Choose 1, 2 or 3 upon placement - will go as far as possible with that limitation)
5 Borderless (If it were to leave through a border, turn clockwise instead - no move)
6 Pusher
7 Unpushable
8 Pusher
9 -
10-
Idea: Give one of them the starting move?
Idea: No-out?
